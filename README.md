**Some things:**  
- Default volume is *50%*. The Options menu includes a **volume slider** and a **mute button**.  
- There are **6** enemies.   
- There is a **tray menu**. Just sayin'!  
- This program uses the Monotype font **Century Gothic**. If you don't have the font installed, the text used may look a little offset and jagged. To install the font, [download](https://freefontsdownload.net/free-century-gothic-font-32089.htm) it here, and unzip it into your **c:\windows\fonts** directory.
