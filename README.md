Some things.  
- Default volume is 50%. The Options menu includes a volume slider and a mute button.  
- There are 6 enemies.  
- Click on the items in the inventory to use them.  
- Green turns = all positive, Red turns = all negative  
- There is a tray menu. Just sayin'!  
- This program uses the Monotype font Century Gothic. If you don't have the font installed, the fonts used may look a little offset and jagged. To install the font, ~[download](https://fontshmontscom.s3.amazonaws.com/century-gothic.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAW2AGDIERC6NPDCWH&Expires=1645729263&Signature=4B7U9G5R6quwXgGlzZn%2BzI8n75s%3D) it here, and unzip it into your c:\windows\fonts directory.
